# python_webscraping_class
Webscraping is the extraction of information for the web. Most types of webscraping involves the parsing of HTML documents.
The purpose of webscraping is that the internet can be seen as one gigantic database, but that information is unstructured. It's meant to be parsed by humans, not code. To aggregate and structure this data, webscraping is required.

Some sites provide APIs, but most do not. APIs can also be very limited.

## Learning goals:
1. Learn how to utilize the Python BeautifulSoup library to webscrape.
2. Analyze and understand the ethics around the utilization of webscraping technology.
3. Dig into HTTP requests with Python.
4. Finalize a webscraping project.


## What data would we want to webscrape?
Data analysts and researches of all kind wish to scrape
- Business information

### Ethics
Servers have limits. Poorly designed webscraping software can impose stress on servers, and serve as quasi-DDoS devices. It's important to have mutual respect for the data being extracted, and the purpose of why it's there, and how those who published the data intended for it ot be used.
